## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm beige (#F5F5DC) evoking the earth and connection to agriculture. This provides a neutral, grounding backdrop suitable for educational content, and aligns with themes relevant to low-resource rural environments.
- Background color: Very light beige (#FAFAF5), almost white. It maintains the theme established in the choice of the primary color but makes the primary color readable.
- Accent color: Soft olive green (#A9BA9D). Chosen for its subtle but cheerful contrast to the analogous palette. It invokes growth and complements the agriculture and resource-based content of the app.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a sans-serif suitable for a fashion and art look. For body, use 'Alegreya' for an intellectual feel. This provides a friendlier more approachable font, compared to some geometric alternatives, reflecting the app's role as a helpful teaching assistant.
- Simple, clear icons representing different subjects (e.g., science, math, literature). Icons should be easily recognizable in low-resource settings.
- Clean, single-column layout optimized for readability on various devices, ensuring ease of use in environments with limited technology.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to provide feedback without being distracting.
