# SahayakAI: Personalized AI Storyteller

SahayakAI is an innovative, AI-powered application designed to create inclusive and personalized educational content. It transforms storytelling by allowing any child to become the hero of their own tale. By uploading a photo, users can generate unique, culturally relevant stories and illustrations where they are the main character, fostering a powerful sense of inclusion and engagement.

This project was built for the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Hackathon, showcasing the model's advanced multi-modal and in-context learning capabilities.

## Core Features

-   **Personalized Character Generation**: Upload a photo to cast yourself or a loved one as the main character of a story.
-   **Multi-modal Storytelling**: The AI generates a unique story inspired by both a text prompt (e.g., "Shivaji the great") and the uploaded image.
-   **Consistent Visual Narrative**: Leveraging Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, the app generates a series of new, stylistically consistent illustrations that place the user's likeness into the story world.
-   **Audio Narration**: Each part of the story is accompanied by AI-generated audio narration, creating a complete audio-visual experience.
-   **Comprehensive Teaching Kits**: For any topic, the app can generate a full teaching kit, including lesson plans, interactive mindmaps, and classroom activities.

## How to Use the Application

1.  **Enter a Topic**: Start by typing a topic or story idea into the main text field (e.g., "A brave astronaut exploring a new planet").
2.  **Upload a Character Image**: Click "Choose Image" to upload a clear photo of the person you want to be the main character. A thumbnail will appear.
3.  **Set Language and Grade**: Specify the language for the story and the target grade level for the student.
4.  **Generate Story**: Click the "Generate Story" button. The AI will create a story based on your topic and the character in the photo.
5.  **Generate Narration & Illustrations**: Once the text is ready, click "Generate Narration & Illustrations". This is where the magic happens! The AI will:
    -   Analyze your photo.
    -   Generate three new, unique illustrations featuring your character within the story's world.
    -   Generate voice narration for each story part.
6.  **Play Slideshow**: Click "Play Slideshow" to view the final story with your personalized character and audio narration.
7.  **Explore Teaching Kit**: Use the "Generate Teaching Kit" button to create a rich set of educational materials based on your topic.

## Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Integration

Our applicationâ€™s core innovation is its deep integration with **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image**, leveraging its advanced features to create a magical and personalized storytelling experience that goes far beyond simple text-to-image.

The central feature, "character consistency," relies on Gemini's powerful **multi-modal understanding**. The image generation flow simultaneously processes a text prompt (the story segment) and an image prompt (the user's photo). The model doesn't just see pixels; it performs **visual in-context learning**, identifying the key facial features and likeness of the person in the photo.

Our carefully engineered prompt then instructs Gemini to perform a complex **style and scene fusion**. It treats the user's photo as a character reference and is commanded to create a *brand new illustration*, re-imagining the user in the context of the story. This could mean adapting their clothing to a historical period or placing them in a fantastical, cinematic environment. This ensures that every generated image is a unique piece of art, perfectly blended into a cohesive visual narrative. This sophisticated use of Gemini's capabilities creates a deeply personal and inclusive experience, making any child the hero of their own story.
